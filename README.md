# Optimisation-of-a-Catalytic-Process-Using-Neural-Network
In recent year, there are increasing concerns over the greenhouse gases in that many environmental issues are associated with the emission of the greenhouse gases. Methane (CH4) and carbon dioxide (CO2) are two major greenhouse gases. Many techniques have been applied to mitigate these greenhouse gases in the environment, among which the dry reforming of methane [1] is particularly used for the production of syngas, an intermediate for producing fuels. 〖CH〗_4  + 〖CO〗_2  ⇌ 2H_2  + 2CO  This method provides a possible solution for both global warming and energy shortages. Therefore, many studies have focused on the evaluation of the catalysts in order to promote this reaction as much as possible. This project aims to predict and optimise the catalytic dry reforming of methane using artificial neural network (ANN) algorithms. Based on the experimental data from previous studies, an ANN model will be constructed and developed to investigate the efficiency of different catalyst compositions, which will assist in analysing experimental data and reduce experimental costs in further studies. This report intends to give a general introduction of this project, and the objectives and expected contributions of the project will be introduced in the following parts. A preliminary introduction to the artificial neural network (ANN) algorithm used in the experiment will also be given in this report.
